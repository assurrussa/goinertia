# basic-app

A minimal Fiber + goinertia example with custom menu, controllers, and views.

This example is intentionally simple and does not include a real Inertia
client bundle. It shows server wiring and props flow.

## Run

From repo root:

```
go run ./goinertia/examples/basic-app
```

Then open:

- http://localhost:8080/ (HTML response)
- Use an Inertia client to make X-Inertia requests if needed.
